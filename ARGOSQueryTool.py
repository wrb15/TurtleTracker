# Create a variable pointing to the file with no header
fileName = "SaraNoHeader.txt"

# Open the file as a read-only file object
fileObj = open(fileName, 'r')

# Read the first line from the open file object
lineStrings = fileObj.readlines()
print ("There are {} records in the file".format(len(lineStrings)))
    
# Close the file object
fileObj.close()

# Create empty dictionaries

# Use a for loop to read each line, one at a time, until the list is exhausted

    # Use the split command to parse the items in lineString into a list object
    lineData = lineString.split("\t")
